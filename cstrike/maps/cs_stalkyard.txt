Stalkyard - Hostage Rescue

Original map by Valve
Edited for Counter-Strike by Freimaurer

Counter-Terrorist-Forces are trying to find the Ark of the Covenant
which is somewhere hidden in a huge storage room at Area 51.
But only a few specialist scienstists are able to recover it.
Too bad, these scientists got kidnapped by an evil group of Terrorists.

Counter-Terrorists:
Rescue the scientists to be able to find the holy Ark of the Covenant.
Beware of mounted machine guns the Terrorists are going to use.

Terrorists:
Defend the scienstists at all cost.
The Ark of the Covenant should never be opened again!

Other Notes: 
There are 2 scienstists hidden somewhere.

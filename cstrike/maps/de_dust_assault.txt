Dust Assault- Bomb/Defuse
by Freimaurer

This is a remix auf the two best maps for Counter-Strike:
de_dust by DaveJ 
cs_assault by CryptR

So this is probably the greatest CS-map EVER! ;)

Counter-Terrorists: Prevent Terrorists
from bombing the chemical weapon crates
in the warehouse and in the backyard.
Team members must defuse any bombs
that threaten targeted areas.

Terrorists: The Terrorist carrying the
C4 must destroy one of the chemical 
weapon stashes. 

Other Notes: There are at least 2 chemical 
weapon stashes in the mission.
